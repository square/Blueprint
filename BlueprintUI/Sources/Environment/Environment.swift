/// Environment is a container for values to be passed down an element tree.
///
/// Environment values are not resolved until the tree is being rendered, so they do not need to be
/// explicitly passed to elements at the time they are created.
///
/// Environment key-value pairs are strongly typed: keys are types conforming to the
/// `EnvironmentKey` protocol, and each key's value is the type of that key's
/// `EnvironmentKey.Value` associated value. Keys must provide a default value.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// To set an environment value, so that it will cascade to child elements, use
/// `AdaptedEnvironment`. Here, every element in `childElement` will have access to `someValue`
/// via the key `MyEnvironmentKey`.
///
///     AdaptedEnvironment(
///         key: MyEnvironmentKey.self,
///         value: someValue,
///         wrapping: childElement
///     )
///
/// To read an environment value, use `EnvironmentReader`. If this element were part of the child
/// element in the previous example, `myValue` would be set to `someValue`. If the key had not
/// been set in an ancestor element, the value would be `MyEnvironmentKey.defaultValue`.
///
///     struct MyElement: ProxyElement {
///         var elementRepresentation: Element {
///             return EnvironmentReader { environment -> Element in
///                 let myValue = environment[MyEnvironmentKey.self]
///                 return SomeElement(using: myValue)
///             }
///         }
///     }
