import Foundation

/// A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that represents the placement of focus.
///
/// Use this property wrapper in conjunction with modifiers on elements that support focus, such as
/// `TextField.focused(when:equals:)` and `TextField.focused(when:)`, to describe when those elements
/// should have focus. When focus enters the modified element, the wrapped value of this property
/// updates to match a given value. Similarly, when focus leaves, the wrapped value of this property
/// resets to `nil` or `false`. Setting this property's value programmatically has the reverse
/// effect, causing focus to move to the element associated with the updated value.
///
/// In the following example of a simple login screen, when the user presses the Sign In button and
/// one of the fields is still empty, focus moves to that field. Otherwise, the sign-in process
/// proceeds.
///
///     struct LoginForm: ProxyElement {
///         enum Field: Hashable {
///             case username
///             case password
///         }
///
///         var username: String
///         var password: String
///         var handleLogin: () -> Void
///
///         @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?
///
///         var elementRepresentation: Element {
///             Column { column in
///                 column.add(
///                     child: TextField(text: "")
///                         .focused(when: $focusedField, equals: .username)
///                 )
///
///                 column.add(
///                     child: TextField(text: "")
///                         .focused(when: $focusedField, equals: .password)
///                 )
///
///                 column.add(
///                     child: Button(
///                         onTap: {
///                             if username.isEmpty {
///                                 focusedField = .username
///                             } else if password.isEmpty {
///                                 focusedField = .password
///                             } else {
///                                 handleLogin()
///                             }
///                         },
///                         wrapping: Label(text: "Sign In")
///                     )
///                 )
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// To allow for cases where focus is completely absent from a view tree, the wrapped value must be
/// either an optional or a Boolean. Set the focus binding to `false` or `nil` as appropriate to
/// remove focus from all bound fields. You can also use this to remove focus from a ``TextField``
/// and thereby dismiss the keyboard.
///
/// ### Auto-Focus
///
/// To auto-focus a field when it appears, set the value in an `onAppear` hook.
///
///     struct Example: ProxyElement {
///         @FocusState var isFocused: Bool
///
///         var elementRepresentation: Element {
///             TextField(text: "")
///                 .focused(when: $isFocused)
///                 .onAppear {
///                     isFocused = true
///                 }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Avoid Ambiguous Focus Bindings
///
/// A `TextField` can have only one focus binding, stored in its `focusBinding` property. If you apply
/// the `focused` modifier multiple times, the last one will overwrite the previous value.
///
/// On the other hand, binding the same value to two views is ambiguous. In the following example,
/// two separate fields bind focus to the `name` value:
///
///     struct Content: ProxyElement {
///         enum Field: Hashable {
///             case name
///             case fullName
///         }
///
///         @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?
///
///         var elementRepresentation: Element {
///             Column { column in
///                 column.add(
///                     child: TextField(text: "")
///                         .focused(when: $focusedField, equals: .name)
///                 )
///
///                 column.add(
///                     child: TextField(text: "")
///                         .focused(when: $focusedField, equals: .name) // incorrect re-use of .name
///                 )
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// If the user moves focus to either field, the `focusedField` binding updates to `name`. However,
/// if the app programmatically sets the value to `name`, the last field bound will be chosen.
