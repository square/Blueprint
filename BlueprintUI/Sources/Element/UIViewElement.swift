///
/// An element type  which makes it easier to wrap an existing `UIView` instance that
/// provides its own sizing via `sizeThatFits`. An instance of the view is used for
/// sizing and measurement, so that you do not need to re-implement your own measurement.
///
/// Note
/// ----
/// The sizing and measurement prototype view is kept alive for the lifetime of the containing application.
/// Do not pass anything to the initializer of this type that you expect to be quickly released.
///
/// Example
/// -------
/// If you were implementing a very basic `Switch` element, your implementation would look something
/// like this:
/// ```
/// struct Switch : UIViewElement
/// {
///     var isOn : Bool
///
///     typealias UIViewType = UISwitch
///
///     func makeUIView() -> UISwitch {
///         UISwitch()
///     }
///
///     func updateUIView(_ view: UISwitch, with context: UIViewElementContext) {
///         view.isOn = self.isOn
///     }
/// }
/// ```
public protocol UIViewElement: Element {

    /// The type of the view associated with the element.
    associatedtype UIViewType: UIView

    /// Create and return a new instance of the provided view type.
    ///
    /// Note
    /// ----
    /// Ensure that you do not pass any values to the initializer of your view type
    /// that you cannot also update in `updateUIView(_:)`, as view instances
    /// are reused for sizing and measurement.
    func makeUIView() -> UIViewType

    /// Update the view instance with the content from the element. The context provides additional
    /// information, such as whether the update is for the measuring instance.
    ///
    /// Example
    /// -------
    /// If you were to implement a simple `UIViewElement` which wraps a `UISwitch`,
    /// your update method would look like this:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// func updateUIView(_ view: UISwitch, with context: UIViewElementContext) {
    ///    view.isOn = self.isOn
    /// }
    /// ```
    func updateUIView(_ view: UIViewType, with context: UIViewElementContext)

    /// Returns the sizing measurement for the element for the provided
    /// measurement view.
    ///
    /// You usually do not need to implement this method – the default implementation of
    /// this method simply calls `sizeThatFits(_:)` on the provided view.
    ///
    /// The view is fully configured and updated before this method is called – you do not need to
    /// update it in any way.
    ///
    /// When To Override
    /// ----------------
    /// You may want to override this method if you need to mutate the value returned from `sizeThatFits(_:)`,
    /// or if you want to use some other sizing method like `systemLayoutSizeFitting(...)`.
